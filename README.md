# BMI Calculator

## Description
This is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented in C++. It allows you to calculate your BMI based on your weight and height using either the imperial (pounds/inches) or metric (kilograms/meters) system.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

## How to Use
1. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository folder.
2. Compile the source code using your C++ compiler:
3. Run the executable:
4. Choose the measurement system you prefer (imperial or metric) by entering the corresponding number (1 or 2).
5. Enter your weight and height as prompted.
6. The BMI will be calculated and displayed along with your weight, height, and status (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).

## Measurement Systems
- **Imperial System**: Weight is in pounds, height is in inches.
- **Metric System**: Weight is in kilograms, height is in meters.

## How BMI is Calculated
The BMI is calculated using the formula:

For Imperial System: BMI = (weight * 703) / (height * height)
For Metric System: BMI = weight / (height * height)

## BMI Categories
- **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5
- **Normal**: 18.5 <= BMI < 25
- **Overweight**: 25 <= BMI < 30
- **Obese**: BMI >= 30

## Note
This BMI calculator is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice. It provides a general assessment of body mass index based on weight and height but does not consider other factors that may affect health.

Feel free to use and modify this code to suit your needs. Enjoy exploring the world of BMI calculations using C++!
